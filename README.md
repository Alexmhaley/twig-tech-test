# twig-techtest
The Twig tech test creating an array splitting function

To run you need to clone the repositry and have a version of python 3 installed on your computer. The program has been tested and works on python 3.7.3 and python 3.6.7 on multiple ubuntu versions


The code for the function is in the split_array.py file, it can either be run separately or imported into another python project

I have included some tests, these can be run by starting the virtual environment by using the command:

source venv/bin/activate 

on linux/macos and then run by using the command:

pytest 

Which should find all the files and output that all tests pass
