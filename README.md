# twig-techtest
The Twig tech test creating an array splitting function

The code for the function is in the split_array.py file, it can either be run separately or imported into another python project

I have included some tests, these can be run by starting the virtual environment by using the command source venv/bin/activate on linux/macos and then run by using the command pytest and it should output that all tests pass
